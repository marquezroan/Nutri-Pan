# Nutri-Pan
Nutri-Pan is a program, which promotes nutrition by improving the availability and reducing the cost of bread freshly baked from flour fortified with Vitamin A and iron among target schools. It is meant to be an investment that demonstrates a sustainable intervention to combat malnutrition.

Two trainings were conducted in Aroroy, Masbate last April 7-8, 2021, and in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro last April 29-30, 2021. A total of three secondary and one elementary schools became beneficiaries of the project funded by ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya Foundation, Inc. - Sagip Kapamilya. 
In June 2021, NCP and Sagip Kapamilya planned to conduct simultaneous trainings in Davao De Oro, Surigao City, Cagayan De Oro, and Biliran. 

Schools and communities with established bakeries are continuously monitored through coordination with the members of the management committee, particularly the school principal or teacher-in-charge via e-mail and SMS. Most of the bakeries are not operational due to the pandemic.
